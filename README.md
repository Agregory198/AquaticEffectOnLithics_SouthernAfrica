# AquaticEffectOnLithics_SouthernAfrica
This repository contains all raw lithic data collected from the Steenbokfontein and Likoaeng assemblages from s Africa. These data were collected to address questions about the affect that aquatic resource exploitation had on hunter-gatherer technological decisions in southern Africa from ~4,500-2,000 years ago.

This project is designed to coninue from 05/31/2024 - 05/31/2026. Data on each assemblaged will be continually added to this page, including raw lithic attribute data (as comma-separated-values), R scripts, Quarto documents, and summary tables.

UPDATE (02-10-2025)
AG_Summer2024_06_26_Final.csv contains the data I collected from Steenbokfontein up to summer 2024

SBF_Results_Section.qmd is an R quarto document that accepts AG_Summer2024_06_26_Final.csv

The quarto document contains preliminary results from the Steenbokfontein pilot data; it also has five supplemental tables at the end containing results from an ANOVA on the data.
